## The Writing Canvas

### Ghost Strokes

Light gray strokes show the target kanji's stroke pattern. Use these as guides:

- Follow the stroke order (top to bottom, left to right)
- Match the general shape and proportions
- Don't trace exactly — develop your own style

### Your Ink

Your strokes appear in black ink with:

- **Pressure sensitivity** — Press harder for thicker lines
- **Natural brush feel** — Simulates a 筆 (fude) brush
- **Real-time rendering** — See your strokes as you write

## Apple Pencil Techniques

### Basic Strokes

| Japanese Term | English | Technique |
|---------------|---------|-----------|
| 横画 (yokkaku) | Horizontal | Steady pressure, slight lift at end |
| 縦画 (jūkaku) | Vertical | Start heavy, maintain through stroke |
| 左払い (hidari-harai) | Left sweep | Heavy start, light fade out |
| 右払い (migi-harai) | Right sweep | Start medium, accelerate with pressure |
| 点 (ten) | Dot | Quick press and lift |

### Stroke Endings

The three essential endings in Japanese calligraphy:

#### 止め (Tome) — Stop
- End the stroke with firm pressure
- Don't lift immediately
- Creates a defined endpoint
- Used in: 一, 二, 三

#### はね (Hane) — Flick
- Quick upward or sideways flick
- Release pressure as you flick
- Creates a hook or tail
- Used in: 小, 子, 手

#### はらい (Harai) — Sweep
- Gradual release of pressure
- Stroke fades to nothing
- Creates flowing, elegant lines
- Used in: 人, 八, 木

### Pressure Control

| Pressure | Line Width | When to Use |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Light | Thin | Stroke endings, connecting strokes |
| Medium | Normal | Most of the stroke body |
| Heavy | Thick | Stroke beginnings, emphasis points |

## AI Feedback System

After submitting your writing, you receive feedback in five categories:

### 1. バランス (Balance)
**What it measures:** Overall proportion and spacing

- Are strokes evenly distributed?
- Is the kanji centered properly?
- Are component parts balanced?

**Tips:**
- Use the ghost strokes as proportion guides
- Leave consistent white space between strokes
- Keep the kanji within the virtual square

### 2. 筆順 (Stroke Order)
**What it measures:** Correct stroke sequence

- Did you follow the standard order?
- Left before right, top before bottom?

**Tips:**
- Practice the basic rules (上から下、左から右)
- Watch the ghost stroke animation
- Stroke order affects the final appearance

### 3. 止め/はね/はらい (Endings)
**What it measures:** Proper stroke terminations

- Are endings crisp and intentional?
- Is the ending type correct for each stroke?

**Tips:**
- Pay attention to the last moment of each stroke
- Reference the ghost strokes for ending types
- Practice the three basic endings separately

### 4. 筆圧 (Pressure)
**What it measures:** Pressure variation and control

- Is there natural variation?
- Are thick/thin transitions smooth?

**Tips:**
- Don't write with constant pressure
- Start strokes with confidence (heavier)
- Let natural hand movement create variation

### 5. 運筆 (Flow)
**What it measures:** Overall stroke rhythm and fluidity

- Are strokes confident or hesitant?
- Is there a natural flow between strokes?

**Tips:**
- Write at a steady pace
- Don't stop mid-stroke
- Practice the full kanji in one fluid motion

## Practice Tips

### For Beginners

1. **Start with simple kanji** — 一, 二, 三, 人, 大
2. **Focus on one aspect** — Master balance before worrying about endings
3. **Use the ghost strokes** — They're there to help
4. **Don't rush** — Quality over speed

### For Intermediate

1. **Reduce ghost stroke opacity** — In Settings, make them fainter
2. **Practice without looking** — Close your eyes for the last stroke
3. **Study real calligraphy** — Look at 書道 examples online
4. **Learn stroke order patterns** — Most kanji follow similar rules

### For Advanced

1. **Hide ghost strokes** — Write from memory
2. **Increase speed** — Fluidity comes from confidence
3. **Develop personal style** — Your writing should be consistent
4. **Practice 連綿 (renmen)** — Connected writing (advanced)

## Common Mistakes

### Problem: Strokes too thin
**Cause:** Not enough pressure
**Fix:** Press firmly, especially at stroke starts

### Problem: Strokes too uniform
**Cause:** Constant pressure throughout
**Fix:** Vary pressure naturally — heavy starts, light ends

### Problem: Poor balance
**Cause:** Not using the full canvas
**Fix:** Write larger, use ghost strokes as guides

### Problem: Hesitant lines
**Cause:** Writing too slowly, overthinking
**Fix:** Commit to each stroke, write with confidence

### Problem: Wrong stroke order
**Cause:** Not following Japanese conventions
**Fix:** Study the basic rules, watch animations
